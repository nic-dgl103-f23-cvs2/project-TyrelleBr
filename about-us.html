        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          The Comox Valley Farmers’ Market Association in a not for profit
          society that has been bringing local food to local folks since 1992.
          Over the last twenty-five plus years we have grown from a seasonal
          Saturday market with a dozen vendors selling product off the tailgate
          of their pickup truck to a year-round Saturday market and two seasonal
          markets with over one hundred vendors selling a wide array of products
          that are grown, made, baked, raised or wild harvested within the Comox
          Valley and Strathcona Regional District.

              Our farmers strive to bring you the freshest produce possible.
              Most produce is harvested and packaged (product dependant) within
              24 hours or less of market day. Some products, such as garlic,
              require curing prior to being sold at the market.

              You are able to use your debit or credit card to purchase market
              tokens. Market tokens or wooden nickles as they are sometimes
              referred to are accepted by all of our vendors and act like cash.
              They tokens come in $5 increments, do not expire, are good year
              round at all of our markets. If you do not spend the value of the
              token the vendor will give you the appropriate change. You can
              purchase these tokens at the Market Information Tent.

              Although we do not have an actual ATM onsite, you are able to use
              your debit or credit card to purchase market tokens or wooden
              nickels as they are often called. Tokens act as “market money” and
              are accepted by all of our vendors. Regular money is given back as
              change when a transaction is less than the amount of tokens given
              for the purchase. You can purchase tokens at the Market
              Information Desk. Note that at our Fall/Winter markets are located
              at the Native Sons Hall in Downtown Courtenay and there are
              several ATM’s located within a few blocks. Both of our seasonal
              summer markets are also located within a few block radius of an
              ATM.
